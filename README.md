# Framingham-Risk-w--OOP  (Complete!)

## Quick Intro and Current Notes
This is a project inspired by some of my C++ coursework.  I am going to create a simple Heart Disease Risk Calculator Program, using OOP. 

It is currently finished, however, my skills have greatly increased since completing this project, and so some of my more recent projects or CS052 coursework is more indicative of my abilities.

However, I still think there are a lot of well done coding in this project and I think it does show a good amount of my abilities.
